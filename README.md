## How to run?

- First of all, download the latest stable version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/.
- Once installed, clone this project's repository. 
- In the project directory, open your favorite terminal and run the next command to install the dependencies needed to run the app:

### `npm install`

Once finished, run the next command to start the app on your default browser:

### `npm start`

Now the app is running in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can also view it from others devices within the same network. The url is the IPv4 of the host executing the app and the port 3000. For example, if the IPv4 of the host executing the app is the 192.168.0.2, the url would be [192.168.0.2:3000](http://192.168.0.2:3000).
